# LATS-Dataset
Introducing the Latin American Transnational Surveillance Dataset (LATS) 
LATS is a micro-level dataset based on declassified foreign surveillance reports produced by autocratic Brazil over two decades (1966-1986). 
Transnational surveillance is a powerful tool in the arsenal of autocrats the world over. Despite its pervasive use in extraterritorial coercion, the systematic study of surveillance of regime opponents beyond national borders remains underdeveloped in Political Science, primarily due to limited data availability. To help fill this gap, we constructed LATS, a micro-level dataset based on declassified foreign surveillance reports produced by autocratic Brazil over two decades (1966-1986). LATS records the identity, locations, social ties, and political activism of 17,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom congregated within and migrated across Latin America. Drawing on this abundant data, we empirically explore existing theoretical insights about the motivations, methods, and consequences of transnational surveillance, a task that would be difficult to do using other sources. We also leverage social network analysis to showcase potential applications of LATS in the testing of collective-action theories of transnational political violence.
